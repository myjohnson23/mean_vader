Use the Express Generate command to create basic website; use EJS views to render a page (similar with ERB in Sinatra/Rails). You are to create a website that makes an $.ajax/$.getJSON request to an API on the server it is on (similar to Sinatra). This API should return JSON with the message of it is a beautiful day and a note of Chicago summers rock. It should then render this data somewhere on the page using jQuery.
